# NeuralNetwork (in progress)

Artificial neural network architecture made primarily for handwritten character recognition.

Neuron class to store information about neurons in the network, including:

-activation (calculated using sigmoid activation function)

-weighted connections to nodes in the next layer

-bias

Network class to store input layer, internal layers, and output layer as vectors. Uses gradient descent and backpropagation 
to train the model, with tests conducted assuming the network is fully-connected

To do:

-Organize and document code

-parse and test dataset
