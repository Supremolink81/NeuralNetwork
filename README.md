# NeuralNetwork (in progress)

Artificial neural network architecture made primarily for handwritten character recognition.

Uses the EMNIST dataset of over 800,000 characters to train and test the model. Excluding a linear algebra library for ease of
linear algebra calculations, all code is done from scratch, including tests and backpropagation. Used 3b1b's videos, as
well as other resources, for theoretical reference.

To do:

-Organize and document code
-parse and test dataset
